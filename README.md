# IBM Data Science Open-Source Tools
Coursera IBM Data Science - Open Source Tools for Data Science 
Lab Exercise (Create and share Jupyter Notebook)

# Assignment Topic:

Create a Jupyter Notebook using IBM Watson Studio. You can choose any language you want (Python, R, or Scala). You will need to include a combination of markdown and code cells. You will likely need to use the Markdown cheatsheet to help you determine the appropriate syntax to style your markdown.

# Guidelines for the submission:

Create your Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio
Include at least 6 cells:
1. Cell 1 (rendered as Markdown): The title should be "My Jupyter Notebook on IBM Data Science Experience", in H1 header styling. The title does not need to be centered.
2. Cell 2 (rendered as Markdown): Your name, in bold characters. In the line below your name, write your current or desired occupation in regular font.
3. Cell 3 (rendered as Markdown): In italic formatting, write one or two sentences about why you are interested in data science. For example, you can start your first sentence with "I am interested in data science because ...".
4. Cell 4 (rendered as Markdown): In H3 header styling, explain in a short sentence what your code is supposed to do in Cell 5.
5. Cell 5 (code cell): Your code, as described in Cell 4. It must be executed and must display an output. Try to keep the code simple (it can even be "1 + 1").
6. Cell 6 (rendered as Markdown): Using Markdown or HTML, this cell must include at least 3 of the following: horizontal rule, bulleted list, numbered list, tables, hyperlinks, images, code/syntax highlighting, blocked quotes, strikethrough.
Submit:

The URL of your publicly shared notebook on IBM Watson Studio.
The main grading criteria will be:

Is the notebook publicly viewable?
Are there, or does there appear to be, at least 5 Markdown cells and 1 code cell?
Are the criteria for each cell fulfilled, as described in the "Guidelines for Submission"?
You will not be judged on:

Your English language, including spelling or grammatical mistakes.
The content of any text or image(s) or where a link is hyperlinked to.
